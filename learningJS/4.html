<h3>注意</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All of these user actions—clicking a button, moving the mouse, moving from one field to another in a form, selecting a different option --- are known as events.</li>
    <li>Inline event-handling means that you combine bits of JavaScript with HTML markup. Although this is not the best way to handle events, but it's the easiest to learn, and can serve as a stepping stone to more advanced methods. </li>
    <li>When the user clicks the link, you don't want a new webpage to be loaded in this case, so, instead of a URL, you place a "#" inside the quotation marks. This tells the browser to reload the current page.</li>
    <li>You place a "JavaScript:void(0)" inside the quotation marks so that nothing at all happens except for the JavaScript that executes.</li>
    <li>When you want to give the user something to click, a more professional approach, usually, is to use a button rather than a link.</li>
